Setting up Rasperry Pi 4
Downloaded Raspbian Buster (4.19) with desktop (not with recommended software)
Flashing with USB is so much faster than through the SD card slot! 
Ran through all the standard setup stuff, updated, rebooted. Running the InstallMate/Scripts/TensorFlowInstall.sh script.
I'm trying a different installation tutorial for tensorflow. I also had to install JavaC to use this tutorial, which uses Bazel (after being built) to install TF. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqCnW_2XDw8
Now following tutorial exactly, because the version (latest) of things was not working. Now I need to set JAVA_HOME.

Forget all that! Instead did the much simpler: https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/tensorflow-ai-raspberry-pi/
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
pip3 install tensorflow

That did successfully do the python import and hello world. Not sure if it has enough to meet my needs, and examples etc.
Now I'm trying to build. Some things are failing, and it says that g++ and gcc were not found.
I uncommented out the buster source from the /etc/apt/sources.list file, and that enabled me to access gcc-4.8.
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8

Then I added these two lines to sources.list:
deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi
deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
And ran:
sudo apt-get install g++-4.8

Don't forget to use raspi-config to enable SPI!
